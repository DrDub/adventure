Introduction
------------

ċWhat you are looking at is a web interface to a text adventure engine
I am developing. This has been my weekend project since one saturday
afternoon in February 2007, when I decided to re-learn Prolog. The
engine adds a feature I was missing most in the text adventure games I
played when I was a kid: *autocompletion* and *synonyms*.

I remember it being most frustrating to know what you want to achieve,
but having no idea whatsoever what a particular item or action was
called by the developer of the game. My engine tries to minimize these
problems.
